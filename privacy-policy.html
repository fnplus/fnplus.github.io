				<h1 id="privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</h1>

				<p>
					Your privacy is critically important to us. At Fnplus Tech, we have
					a few fundamental principles:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to
							provide and the personal information that we collect about you
							through the operation of our services.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							We store personal information for only as long as we have a
							reason to keep it.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what
							information on your website is shared publicly (or kept
							private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							We help protect you from overreaching government demands for
							your personal information.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share
							your personal information.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					To keep things simple, in this Privacy Notice we’ll refer to the
					users of the services we provide through these products and
					services--such as a website’s administrator, contributor, author, or
					editor--as our “Users,” and we’ll refer to our Users’ websites as
					“Sites.” Visitors to those Sites can read published content and
					interact with the Sites through features such as comments, likes,
					poll/survey responses, and follows. We put together this Privacy
					Notice to help our Users understand the information we collect about
					their Site visitors (a/k/a our Users’ users), and how that happens
					on their Sites.
				</p>

				<h3 id="informationwecollectaboutvisitorstoouruserssites">
					Information We Collect About Visitors to Our Users’ Sites
				</h3>

				<p>
					We collect information about visitors to our Users’ Sites in a few
					different ways--we collect certain information that the visitors
					provide to the Site, we collect some information automatically, and
					we collect any information that our Users provide to us about their
					visitors.
				</p>

				<h4 id="_informationavisitorprovidestoasite_">
					<em>Information a Visitor Provides to a Site</em>
				</h4>

				<p>
					We’ll start with information that visitors provide directly to a
					Site, which primarily happens when visitors type into a text field
					on a Site, like a comment field or a sign-up form. Our Users may
					also implement other ways to allow Site visitors to provide
					information directly through their Sites. Here are the most common
					ways in which a visitor directly provides information to a Site:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Follower and Subscriber Information:</strong> When a
							visitor signs up to follow or subscribe our services, we collect
							the sign-up information requested by the Site, which typically
							includes an email address.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Site Comments:</strong> When a visitor leaves a comment
							on a Site, we collect that comment, and other information that
							the visitor provides along with the comment, such as the
							visitor’s name and email address.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Crowdsignal Survey Responses:</strong> When a visitor
							completes a poll, quiz, or other type of survey prepared by a
							User via Crowdsignal.com, we collect the visitor’s responses to
							those surveys, and other information that the survey owner
							requires for a poll/quiz/survey response, like an e-mail
							address.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Order and Shipment Information:</strong> If a visitor
							orders something (hooray!) from a Site using our store and
							ecommerce features available through fnplus.tech, we may collect
							information to process that order, such as credit card and
							billing information, and an address for shipping the package
							along to the recipient and calculating applicable taxes. We may
							also use this information for other purposes on behalf of our
							Users--for example, to send marketing and other communications
							from our Users to their customers, and to provide our User with
							analytics information about their ecommerce site (e.g., the
							number of orders from particular geographic areas).
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Other Information Entered on the Site:</strong> We may
							also collect other information that a visitor enters on the
							Site--such as a contact form submission, a search query, or Site
							registration.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4 id="_informationweautomaticallycollectfromthesite_">
					<em>Information We Automatically Collect from the Site</em>
				</h4>

				<p>
					We also automatically collect some information about visitors to a
					Site. The information we automatically collect depends on which of
					our services the Site uses. We’ve listed examples below:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Technical Data from a Visitor's Computer and
								Etcetera:</strong>
							We collect the information that web browsers, mobile devices,
							and servers typically make available about visitors to a Site,
							such as the IP address, browser type, unique device identifiers,
							language preference, referring site, the date and time of
							access, operating system, and mobile network information.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Visitor Interactions:</strong> We collect information
							about a visitor’s interactions with a Site, including the
							“likes” and “ratings” left by visitors.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Location Information:</strong> We may determine the
							approximate location of a visitor’s device from the IP address.
							We collect and use this information to, for example, tally for
							our Users how many people visit their Sites from certain
							geographic regions.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Crowdsignal Response Information:</strong> We collect
							information about visitors who respond to a Crowdsignal survey.
							The information that we collect typically includes IP address,
							browser type, operating system, user agent, and the web page
							last visited.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Intense Debate Commenter Information:</strong> We
							collect information about visitors who comment on Sites that use
							our Intense Debate service. The information that we collect
							depends on how the User sets up Intense Debate for the Site, but
							typically includes the IP address and account information on the
							Site, along with the comment.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Jetpack Site Activity:</strong> We collect visitor
							activities related to the management of the Site, such as login
							attempts/actions and comment submission and management actions.
							For more information, please see the
							<a href="https://jetpack.com/support/privacy/">Jetpack Privacy Center</a>.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Information from Cookies and Other Technologies:</strong>
							A cookie is a string of information that a Site stores on a
							visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to
							the Site each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called
							web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on Sites.
							Fnplus uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags
							to help identify and track visitors and Site usage, and to
							deliver targeted ads when ads are enabled for free WordPress.com
							sites or when ads are enabled on a Site through WordAds or
							Jetpack Ads (see the “Other Tools” section below for more
							details). For more information about our use of cookies and
							other technologies for tracking, including how visitors can
							control the use of cookies, please see our
							<a href="https://github.com/fnplus/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4 id="_otherinformationprovidedbyourusers_">
					<em>Other Information Provided by Our Users</em>
				</h4>

				<p>
					We also collect any other information that our Users provide to us
					about visitors to their Sites. For example, a User may upload a
					directory or other information about Site visitors and customers to
					the “backend” administrative platform for managing the Site.
				</p>

				<h3 id="howweusevisitorinformation">
					How We Use Visitor Information
				</h3>

				<p>
					We use information about Site visitors in order to provide our
					Services to our Users and their Sites. Our users may use our
					Services to, for example, create and manage their Site, sell
					products and services on their Site, flag and fight comments from
					spammers, and collect information through polls, quizzes and other
					surveys. We may also use and share information that has been
					aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information
					could not reasonably be used to identify any individual. For
					instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our
					services.
				</p>

				<h3 id="howwesharevisitorinformation">
					How We Share Visitor Information
				</h3>

				<p>
					We may share information collected about Site visitors in the
					limited circumstances spelled out below:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors:</strong>
							We may disclose Site visitor information to our subsidiaries,
							our employees, and individuals who are our independent
							contractors that need to know the information in order to help
							us provide our services to our Users and their Sites, or to
							process the information on our behalf. We require our
							subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow
							this Privacy Notice for information about visitors that we share
							with them.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Third Party Vendors:</strong> We may share Site visitor
							information with third party vendors who need to know this
							information in order to provide their services to us. This group
							includes vendors that help us provide our services to our Users
							and their Sites. We require vendors to agree to privacy
							commitments in order to share information with them.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Legal Requests:</strong> We may disclose Site visitor
							information in response to a subpoena, court order, or other
							governmental request.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:</strong> We may
							disclose Site visitor information when we believe in good faith
							that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property
							or rights of Fnplus, our Users, third parties, or the public
							at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there
							is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we
							may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with any
							merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a
							portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely
							event that Fnplus goes out of business or enters bankruptcy,
							Site visitor information would likely be one of the assets that
							is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these
							events were to happen, this Privacy Notice would continue to
							apply to Site visitor information and the party receiving this
							information may continue to use this information, but only
							consistent with this Privacy Notice.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Information Shared Publicly:</strong> Information that
							visitors choose to make public is–you guessed it–disclosed
							publicly. That means, of course, that information like visitor
							comments and “likes” are all available to others, including
							information about the visitor that is displayed in connection
							with a comment or “like” (such as a visitor’s WordPress.com
							username and Gravatar). We provide a “firehose” stream of public
							data (including comments) from Sites to provide that data to
							firehose subscribers, who may view and analyze the content, but
							do not have rights to re-publish it publicly. Public information
							may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 id="yourrights">Your Rights</h3>

				<p>
					If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall
					under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation
					(AKA the “GDPR”), data protection laws give you rights with respect
					to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the
					law, including the rights to:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Request access to your personal data;</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal
							data; and
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Request portability of your personal data.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using
					your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren’t
					able to do that, or you would like to contact us about one of the
					other rights, scroll down to How to Reach Us to, well, find out how
					to reach us. EU individuals also have the right to make a complaint
					to a government supervisory authority.
				</p>

				<h3 id="howtoreachus">How to Reach Us</h3>

				<p>
					If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like
					to contact us about any of the rights mentioned in the Your Rights
					section above, please
					<a href="mailto:hellofnplus@gmail.com">contact us</a>.
				</p>

				<h3 id="privacypolicychanges">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

				<p>
					Although most changes are likely to be minor, Fnplus may change
					its Privacy Policy from time to time. Fnplus encourages visitors
					to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
					If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log
					below. Your further use of the Services after a change to our
					Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy. That’s it!
					Thanks for reading.
